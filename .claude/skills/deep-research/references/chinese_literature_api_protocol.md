# Chinese-Literature Verification Protocol

**Status**: standalone client (#595) — NOT wired into the citation verification gate
**Used by**: `scripts/chinese_literature_client.py`
**API bases**: `https://doi.org`, `https://hdl.handle.net`, `https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils`
**API keys**: none required. PubMed use requires a caller-supplied `ncbi_email`; an optional NCBI key may also be passed to the client constructor and does NOT relax pacing.
**Live examples in this document were re-verified on 2026-07-27.**

## Purpose

`api.crossref.org` is **one DOI registration agency (RA), not the DOI system**. Chinese-language literature DOIs are predominantly registered with **ISTIC** or **CNKI**, both of which are invisible to the Crossref API while resolving normally through `doi.org`. The existing four ARS resolvers (Semantic Scholar / OpenAlex / Crossref / arXiv) therefore reduce almost every Chinese reference to `unresolvable` — the same state a fabricated reference produces. OpenAlex indexes roughly 37% of Chinese core-list journals and 24% of their articles (arXiv:2512.16339), but for the motivating example it serves an English bracketed shadow title rather than the cited Chinese title. That cross-language pair fails both exact-normalized matching and the 0.70 similarity floor, so an upstream record existing there still cannot verify the Chinese citation.

This protocol documents four open, key-free endpoints that do close a usable part of it, and — equally important — documents exactly where they stop.

## Endpoints

### 1. Registration-agency triage — `GET https://doi.org/doiRA/<prefix>`

Zero-cost routing. Supports comma-batched prefixes. Response is a JSON array of `{"DOI": <prefix>, "RA": <agency>}`.

Verified 2026-07-27:

```
$ curl -s 'https://doi.org/doiRA/10.3760,10.3969,10.13209,10.1360'
[{"DOI":"10.3760","RA":"ISTIC"},{"DOI":"10.3969","RA":"ISTIC"},
 {"DOI":"10.13209","RA":"CNKI"},{"DOI":"10.1360","RA":"Crossref"}]
```

| prefix | RA | note |
|---|---|---|
| `10.3760` | ISTIC | Chinese Medical Association journals (yiigle.com) |
| `10.3969` | ISTIC | a large block of Chinese journals |
| `10.13209` | CNKI | e.g. *Acta Scientiarum Naturalium Universitatis Pekinensis* |
| `10.1360` | Crossref | *Science China* series |

An unknown prefix does not return an error: the endpoint answers 200 with a `status` field in place of `RA` (verified 2026-07-27: `GET /doiRA/10.99999` → `[{"DOI": "10.99999", "status": "DOI does not exist"}]`). The client requires exactly one row whose echoed `DOI` equals the requested prefix. Only that documented not-found status becomes "no agency"; a missing, non-string, empty, control-bearing, or otherwise malformed `RA` raises `Unavailable`. Routing metadata never produces a verdict on its own, and a supplied DOI whose agency is unknown or outside this client's ISTIC/CNKI scope is never silently discarded in favour of DOI-less coordinates.

**Crossref-registered Chinese DOIs are deliberately NOT claimed by this resolver** — the existing `crossref_client.py` already covers them, and re-querying would burn quota while amplifying the Chinese fuzzy-match false positives measured below.

### 2. Content negotiation — `GET https://doi.org/<doi>` with `Accept: application/vnd.citationstyles.csl+json`

For an **ISTIC**-registered DOI, content negotiation can support an ID + title cross-check only when the DOI resolver returns CSL-JSON carrying the **original Chinese title and Chinese journal name** over an allowlisted HTTPS path. Registration with ISTIC alone does not establish that this safe metadata path is available.

Manual observation on 2026-07-27 yielded the following body for `10.3760/cma.j.cn112137-20231008-00670` after following the DOI resolver's external redirect behaviour. This is historical context for the desired metadata shape, **not evidence the client accepts**:

```json
{
  "DOI": "10.3760/cma.j.cn112137-20231008-00670",
  "title": "宫颈腺癌中ProEXC和PRMT5的表达及其临床意义",
  "container-title": "中华医学杂志",
  "volume": "103", "issue": "48", "page": "3967",
  "type": "article-journal",
  "author": [{"given": "Cui Hongxia"}]
}
```

Rechecked 2026-08-01, the HTTPS request for that DOI redirects to `http://122.115.55.36:8000/doi/...`: plaintext, a bare IP, and outside the allowlist. The client refuses that hop before reading its body and raises `ChineseLiteratureUnavailable`; this example therefore produces **no `MATCH` or `MISMATCH` verdict**. Automatic ISTIC title verification is available only if a requested DOI exposes comparable CSL metadata without leaving the allowlisted HTTPS boundary.

The same DOI returns **HTTP 404** from `https://api.crossref.org/works/<doi>` — this one pair of requests is the entire motivation for the resolver.

Known metadata defects, defended against in `_csl_to_dict`:

- `author` often collapses an entire name into `given` with no family/given split, and mixes pinyin with Han characters. **Authors are display-only and are never a match criterion.**
- `page` frequently carries the first page only (no `page-last`).
- `issued` may be absent → year is `None` and the year check is *skipped*, not failed. Absence is not mismatch.
- `title` is occasionally a single-element list rather than a string.
- `DOI` may be absent, in which case the DOI-keyed request path is retained in evidence. If present it must be a non-empty, case-insensitive exact match for the requested DOI; a mismatched or malformed echo raises instead of attaching another record's title to the citation.

### 3. Existence probe — `GET https://hdl.handle.net/api/handles/<doi>`

Returns `{"responseCode": 1, ...}` when the handle exists and `{"responseCode": 100, ...}` when it does not. These observations are accepted only as exact JSON integers (not booleans or floats); any other type/code is an unknown state and degrades.

Verified 2026-07-27:

| identifier | `responseCode` | content negotiation |
|---|---|---|
| `10.3760/cma.j.cn112137-20231008-00670` (real, ISTIC) | `1` | currently redirects to a plaintext bare-IP target; the client refuses it before reading metadata |
| `10.3760/cma.j.cn112137-20239999-99999` (fabricated) | `100` | `404` |
| `10.13209/j.0479-8023.2019.001` (real, CNKI) | `1` | `200` + **HTML**, not CSL-JSON |

**There is no wildcard catch-all on these prefixes**, so a `responseCode: 100` is a trustworthy negative — this is what licenses a `false` verdict contribution for a refuted identifier under C-V6(a) (ID-keyed unmatched).

### 4. PubMed E-utilities — coordinate lookup for DOI-less Chinese medical citations

Three steps, in order, none skippable:

**4a. ISSN → NLM title abbreviation.** PubMed does not accept Chinese journal names (`term=中华医学杂志` in NLM Catalog returns 0). GB/T 7714 references do not carry ISSNs either, so the client keeps an offline 中文刊名 → ISSN → NLM TA bridge table.

```
GET esearch.fcgi?db=nlmcatalog&retmode=json&term=0376-2491[issn]   -> NLM 7511141
GET esummary.fcgi?db=nlmcatalog&retmode=json&id=7511141            -> medlineta "Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi"
```

**4b. Coverage confirmation — "the journal has ≥ 1 PubMed record", not "the journal is in the NLM Catalog".** These differ in practice, and conflating them manufactures meaningless misses:

| journal | ISSN | NLM ID | MEDLINE TA | PubMed records |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 中华医学杂志 | 0376-2491 | 7511141 | `Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi` | 19 347 |
| 中华内科杂志 | 0578-1426 | 161387 | `Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi` | 7 726 |
| 中华外科杂志 | 0529-5815 | 153611 | `Zhonghua Wai Ke Za Zhi` | 11 216 |
| 中华儿科杂志 | 0578-1310 | 417427 | `Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi` | 6 167 |
| 中华流行病学杂志 | 0254-6450 | 8208604 | `Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi` | 8 924 |
| 中国全科医学 | 1007-9572 | 101299195 | *(none)* | **0** |

All rows verified 2026-07-27. The last row is the counterexample that forces the rule: the journal is catalogued but carries no MEDLINE abbreviation and no articles, so a coordinate miss against it would say nothing at all.

**4c. Coordinate query.** `[ta] AND [vi] AND [pg]`; `[ta] AND [1au] AND [dp]` is used only when volume + first page is unavailable. It is not run after a zero or ambiguous volume/page result, because doing so could wash a cited wrong page into a positive match.

```
"Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi"[ta] AND 103[vi] AND 3967[pg]  -> count=1, PMID 38129175
"Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi"[ta] AND 103[vi] AND 9999[pg]  -> count=0   (fabricated page)
```

The coordinate tuple is a deterministic **candidate query**, not a fuzzy title match and not final verification. ESearch accepts only unique numeric-string PMIDs and requires the returned `idlist` length to equal `min(count, retmax)` exactly; an incomplete, overlong, duplicated, or internally inconsistent page raises instead of becoming a false zero-hit or ambiguous result. A multi-record result is reported as `ambiguous` with no record attached — the client never picks one of several. For the single-PMID ESummary request, any present `result.uids` or record-level `uid` echo must identify exactly that requested PMID; a mismatched/malformed echo raises rather than binding another record's DOI/title. An absent/empty `pubdate` means the year is unavailable, but a present value must begin with a four-digit ASCII year in the documented ESummary shape; malformed or Unicode-digit values raise instead of silently disabling the year conflict check.

**Critical limitation, measured 2026-07-27.** For a Chinese-language article, `esummary` returns the **English bracketed shadow title**, never the Chinese original:

```json
{"title": "[Expression of ProEXC and PRMT5 in cervical adenocarcinoma ...].",
 "source": "Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi", "volume": "103", "pages": "3967-3971",
 "lang": ["chi"], "issn": "0376-2491",
 "articleids": [{"idtype": "doi", "value": "10.3760/cma.j.cn112137-20231008-00670"}]}
```

A Chinese-to-English title cross-check is therefore **structurally impossible inside PubMed**. A unique coordinate hit is only a **candidate**, never a match by itself. The candidate's echoed ISSN, year, volume, and first page must not conflict wherever both sides provide them, and its DOI must then route to a Chinese RA that provides a machine-readable Chinese title. Only an ISTIC DOI whose CSL title is obtained within the allowlisted HTTPS boundary and exactly matches the cited Chinese title is promoted to `PUBMED_COORDINATE_VERIFIED`. No DOI, an unknown or non-Chinese RA, CNKI Handle existence without a title, a missing/unverifiable CSL title, a title mismatch, or any structural conflict all remain title-keyed `unresolvable`; none is negative evidence about the citation. Transport, unsafe redirect, non-JSON, or malformed-payload failure instead raises `ChineseLiteratureUnavailable` for the caller to map to `unreachable` — it never becomes a verdict.

## Rate-limit etiquette

| host | client interval | basis |
|---|---|---|
| `doi.org`, `hdl.handle.net` | 0.2 s min interval | neither publishes a floor; mirrors the anonymous pacing of the sibling index clients |
| `eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov` | 0.34 s min interval | NCBI asks for ≤ 3 req/s without an API key |

Pacing is per-instance and uses `time.monotonic` (NTP/manual clock adjustments can run `time.time` backwards, #128 §6). Every E-utilities request carries fixed `tool=academic-research-skills` plus the caller-supplied `ncbi_email`; a PubMed branch without a valid email fails closed before transport. An NCBI API key, when supplied, is passed through but does **not** relax the interval — staying polite is cheaper than defending a ban. Two independent throttle anchors are kept, since sharing one would either over-throttle DOI lookups or under-throttle NCBI.

## Degradation handling

| condition | action |
|---|---|
| DOI/Handle `404`, Handle `responseCode: 100` | meaningful typed observations — reported as data, never as degradation. On the ISTIC content-negotiation branch, a CSL 404 alone is `NOT_FOUND`; only CSL 404 plus independent Handle absence supports `DOI_REFUTED`. On the CNKI existence-only branch, an exact-integer Handle 100 directly refutes the identifier. |
| HTTP 429 | backoff (≥ 2 s, growing per attempt) then retry, up to `_MAX_RETRIES`; anchor refreshed after the sleep; raise on exhaustion |
| HTTP 5xx | **no retry** — raise immediately (fail fast; the tests pin the request count at 1) |
| network error / timeout (30 s) | raise |
| redirect with no valid `Location`, or to HTTP, a bare IP, userinfo/port, or a non-allowlisted host | refuse before following and raise; HTTPS + exact host is revalidated on every hop and on the final response URL; redirect bodies are closed without being read |
| transport returns a response object with a missing/malformed status or any non-2xx status outside the typed 404 path | close without reading and raise; injected/alternate transports cannot bypass HTTP status semantics |
| `Content-Length` over 2 MiB, non-ASCII/non-decimal malformed length, or body exceeding 2 MiB | refuse before reading where possible; otherwise bounded-read `2 MiB + 1` and raise |
| truncated body (`IncompleteRead`, inherits `HTTPException` not `OSError`) | raise |
| 200 with an unparseable body | raise — a proxy/CDN HTML error page served with 200 must never be recorded as an empty result (#331) |
| 200 CSL request that returns non-JSON | raise typed `Unavailable` — it may be a proxy/CDN error page and cannot drive a verdict |
| parseable CSL object with no usable title, no usable cited title, or a cross-script / romanized title difference | typed `UNVERIFIABLE` → `unresolvable` + a P2 checklist row; a translation difference is not chimeric-citation evidence |
| any of the above | `ChineseLiteratureUnavailable` is raised without retaining untrusted transport text as an exception cause; the caller MUST map it to `unreachable` and MUST NOT read it as evidence about existence |

`resolve()` has no `unreachable` return value by design: degradation raises, so a network outage can never be silently rendered as a lookup result.

## Chinese title matching

The shared `_text_similarity.exact_normalized_title` (#431 exact-title-or-bust) **was** ASCII-centric. Measured 2026-07-27 against the real ISTIC title above, it **rejected three legitimate spellings of the identical title**:

| variant | shared `_similarity` | shared `exact_normalized_title` |
|---|---|---|
| identical string | 1.000 | ✅ true |
| fullwidth latin/digits (ＰｒｏＥＸＣ) | 0.577 | ❌ false |
| trailing CJK punctuation (`。`) | 0.981 | ❌ false |
| interior spaces around latin runs | 0.929 | ❌ false |
| a genuinely **different** paper on a related topic | **0.510** | ❌ false |

> **Repaired.** `normalize_cn_title` / `has_cjk` were promoted from this client into `scripts/_text_similarity.py`, so the four index resolvers (Semantic Scholar / OpenAlex / Crossref / arXiv) now apply the same Chinese-aware rule. `exact_normalized_title` gains the CJK form as an additive third branch, and `_similarity` folds it in through the existing `max`. Both changes are gated on **both** sides carrying a Han ideograph, so behaviour off that path is unchanged; a cross-script or romanized pair still cannot match. Two resolver paths were affected: the DOI-keyed cross-check (which gates on the ratio *alone*, so a legitimate fullwidth variant at 0.625 became `DOI_MISMATCH`) and the title-fallback search (which requires ratio **and** exact equality, so the same variant fell to `unresolvable`). Under the Chinese-aware form the ratio also regains its discriminative power on this pair — 1.000 for the identical title against an unchanged 0.510 for the unrelated one. The exclusion of the fuzzy ratio from `_cn_titles_match` itself (conclusion 2 below) is unchanged.

Two conclusions drive `normalize_cn_title` / `_cn_titles_match`:

1. **Normalization must be Chinese-aware and conservative**: explicitly fold only fullwidth ASCII forms, collapse whitespace, remove whitespace only where it touches a Han character, and remove only conventional inert outer title wrappers (`《》`, `「」`, `『』`, `【】`, curly quotation pairs) plus terminal `。`/`.` (fullwidth `．` is folded to `.` first). Whitespace between non-CJK tokens and letter case are retained: deleting or case-folding them can collapse scientific names such as `PD L1` versus `PDL 1`, or `P53` versus `p53`. Whole-string NFKC/casefold is forbidden because it can also collapse `2²` with `22` and `Straße` with `Strasse`; deleting broad punctuation/symbol categories likewise collapses scientific titles such as `ER+` versus `ER-`, `CD4+` versus `CD4−`, and `4.5%` versus `45%`. Question/exclamation marks are retained because they can distinguish otherwise identical titles.
2. **The shared fuzzy ratio is excluded from the rule entirely**, in both directions. It is not *sufficient*: an unrelated paper already scores 0.510 on Han-character overlap alone, and a Crossref bibliographic query for this exact Chinese title returned a completely different paper as its top hit. And — the non-obvious half, caught by a live smoke run rather than by reasoning — it is not safe as an extra *necessary* condition either: the fullwidth spelling of the identical title scores **0.577, below the 0.70 floor**, so ANDing the ratio in would veto a match that exact normalization had correctly established and file a real paper at **P0, next to the word "fabricated"**. Read the table again: 0.510 for an unrelated paper against 0.577 for an identical one. On CJK titles the threshold separates almost nothing, so it earns no place in the decision.

The operative positive rule is therefore: **exact equality after Chinese-aware normalization**. The comparison occurs only after a DOI-keyed lookup, so the `generic_title` veto used by identifier-free title searches does not apply — a real DOI may legitimately be titled “Editorial”. A negative is narrower: only two non-empty titles that both contain CJK ideographs are comparable strongly enough for a normalized difference to become `MISMATCH`. If either side is Latin-only, romanized, or otherwise cross-script, the difference is `UNVERIFIABLE`; this client has no translation oracle and cannot turn an English shadow title into chimeric-citation evidence.

Simplified/Traditional folding is deliberately **not** performed: it is lossy for proper nouns, and a wrong fold would manufacture a false match. The variant pair is surfaced to the human instead.

Every applicable non-matched outcome emits one human-confirmation checklist item. A Stage 0 `NOT_CHINESE_LITERATURE` skip is outside the resolver's applicability scope and intentionally emits none.
```

## Three-state semantics — why a miss is never "fabricated"

The resolver's outcomes use the `citation_verification_summary.py` vocabulary verbatim (`matched` / `unmatched` / `skipped`, `queried_by ∈ {id, title, None}`) — but that claim is deliberately scoped to the **status/queried_by semantic layer only**. Under the existing reducer, `false` requires **ID-keyed** unmatched; a title-keyed unmatched reduces to `unresolvable`, and every mapping in the table below reduces correctly through the unmodified reducer.

A gate wiring would still be a real schema-side change, not a mechanical one. Recorded here so the #593 issue-first integration starts from an honest delta list:

1. **`resolver_outcomes` is locked to exactly four keys.** The passport schema pins `additionalProperties: false` with `required: [crossref, openalex, semantic_scholar, arxiv]` ("Exactly four fields, one per resolver — ALL required"). A fifth resolver means editing the schema, the k=0..4 triangulation matrix and its set-equality lints, and the degradation registry — none of which this standalone PR touches.
2. **The coordinate query borrows `queried_by: "title"`.** The schema describes `title` as "only a title search was possible"; a `[ta]+[vi]+[pg]` coordinate query is not a title search. The borrowing is directionally safe — the point is that a non-identifier key must never produce `false`, exactly C-V6(a) — but at wiring time the schema's `queried_by` description needs revising (or a third enum value) rather than silently stretching.
3. **`skipped` here can follow real requests.** The schema describes `skipped` as "resolver did not run", while the `NO_ISSN_MAPPING` / `JOURNAL_NOT_INDEXED` outcomes return `skipped` after the RA lookup or coverage probe has already executed. Reducer-compatible (skipped is excluded from the verdict set, which is precisely what "our table's gap is not evidence" needs), but the schema's `skipped` description needs an "or ran and found no applicable automated source" clause at wiring time.
4. **The PubMed branch needs citation fields the current corpus-entry schema does not carry.** `container_title`, `volume`, `pages`, and `first_author_pinyin` must be added or explicitly mapped at integration time; the standalone client must not imply those inputs already exist upstream.

The design is **deliberately asymmetric — negatives strong, positives conservative**:

| outcome | `status` | `queried_by` | reduces to | why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ISTIC DOI returns allowlisted-HTTPS CSL, Chinese title matches | `matched` | `id` | `true` | identifier + title, double evidence |
| ISTIC DOI returns allowlisted-HTTPS CSL, and two non-empty CJK titles differ | `unmatched` | `id` | `false` | comparable-title chimeric-citation evidence |
| DOI refuted (ISTIC CSL 404 + Handle 100, or CNKI Handle 100) | `unmatched` | `id` | `false` | no wildcard catch-all — a fabricated identifier is cleanly refuted |
| DOI exists, title unverifiable (CNKI RA; ISTIC record/citation lacks a comparable title; titles differ across scripts / romanization; or CSL 404 plus Handle existence) | `unmatched` | `title` | `unresolvable` | ⭐ deliberate demotion (below) |
| DOI agency unknown | `skipped` | `None` | excluded | supplied DOI is retained for P2 human check; no coordinate fallback |
| DOI agency outside ISTIC/CNKI | `skipped` | `None` | excluded | route to the appropriate DOI resolver; no coordinate fallback |
| PubMed candidate DOI returns an exact Chinese ISTIC title over an allowlisted HTTPS path | `matched` | `title` | `true` | coordinates nominate; DOI + Chinese title bind |
| PubMed candidate has no DOI / out-of-scope RA / CNKI existence only / missing-unverifiable or mismatching title / structural conflict | `unmatched` | `title` | `unresolvable` | ⭐ candidate-only, never `false`; upstream failure raises instead |
| PubMed indexed, coordinates return 0 | `unmatched` | `title` | `unresolvable` | ⭐ never `false` |
| coordinates ambiguous (>1 record) | `unmatched` | `title` | `unresolvable` | we never pick one of several |
| journal unmapped / insufficient coordinates / not PubMed-indexed | `skipped` | `None` | excluded | no applicable automated lookup ≠ negative |
| non-Chinese citation | `skipped` | `None` | excluded | English corpora untouched |

Three ⭐ demotions carry the weight of the design:

- **CNKI existence never becomes `matched`.** A real DOI carrying a fabricated title would otherwise be waved through. Because the CNKI RA serves HTML rather than CSL-JSON and we refuse to parse it, "exists" is all we honestly have.
- **A coordinate miss never becomes `false`**, for three independent reasons: the journal-name → NLM TA bridge is heuristic and a wrong row would condemn a real paper; PubMed indexes Chinese journals selectively, so "the journal is indexed" does not imply "this volume is indexed"; and C-V6(a) defines `false` as ID-keyed unmatched, which a coordinate tuple is not. The strength of the signal goes into the **checklist priority (P1)**, not into the verdict. That is where precision-over-recall belongs.
- **A coordinate hit is only a candidate.** PubMed's English shadow title cannot verify the cited Chinese title. Promotion requires a candidate DOI that routes to ISTIC plus an exact machine-readable Chinese-title match obtained without leaving the allowlisted HTTPS boundary. Every failed binding stays `PUBMED_COORDINATE_CANDIDATE_UNVERIFIED`; an unsafe redirect or transport failure raises `ChineseLiteratureUnavailable` and produces no verdict at all.
- **An unmapped journal is `skipped`, not `unmatched`.** A gap in our table is a fact about our table.

### Human-confirmation checklist

Every applicable non-matched outcome produces one checklist item with a priority that is **workload ordering, not a suspicion score**:

| priority | reason codes | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **P0** | `DOI_REFUTED`, `DOI_TITLE_MISMATCH` | the identifier is absent, or it resolves to a different title — the only tier where fabrication vocabulary is permitted at all |
| **P1** | `PUBMED_INDEXED_BUT_COORDINATE_MISS`, `PUBMED_COORDINATE_AMBIGUOUS` | the journal is indexed but the cited coordinates return nothing/too much |
| **P2** | `DOI_EXISTS_TITLE_UNVERIFIABLE`, `DOI_RA_UNRESOLVED`, `PUBMED_COORDINATE_CANDIDATE_UNVERIFIED` | a DOI/title binding cannot be machine-confirmed, or the supplied DOI's agency could not be established; do not infer validity from coordinates or existence alone |
| **P3** | `INSUFFICIENT_PUBMED_COORDINATES`, `JOURNAL_NOT_INDEXED`, `NO_ISSN_MAPPING`, `DOI_RA_OUT_OF_SCOPE` | no automated source in this client applies. **This is the normal case** for incomplete, social-science, non-core-journal, pre-digital, and other-RA literature, and is not suspicious |

`human_result` is initialized to `None` and the tool **never** fills it: the judgement is the human's. Wording discipline is enforced in the item text — P1/P2/P3 read "pending human check", because mislabeling a real paper by a real author as suspected fabrication costs far more than missing one bad citation.

## Legal and compliance boundary

**Zero scraping.** CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP search and full-text pages are never fetched or parsed. The four endpoints above are the DOI Foundation's, the Handle System's, and NCBI's official machine-facing services, all open and key-free, all documented for programmatic access.

The concrete cost of this line: a CNKI-registered DOI's resolution page **does** display its title to a human eye, and parsing that HTML would let the resolver auto-verify those citations. We do not do it. Structured extraction from CNKI's pages is a terms-of-service and legal exposure we decline to take on behalf of users, so the CNKI branch stops at existence and asks a person to click one link. That is the boundary of "semi-automatic" in this design.

Also excluded, and why:

- **CSTR (cstr.cn)** — record-detail access is authenticated and therefore not key-free for an open-source default. This client does not require users to provision an institutional credential.
- **chinadoi.cn** — a JavaScript SPA with no documented interface. No documentation means no authorization. (Its DOIs resolve fine through `doi.org`, which is what we use.)
- **NSTL** — metadata access requires an institutional service agreement, which an open-source skill cannot require of every user.
- **CQVIP** — no public literature-search API, and its terms prohibit crawling.

## What this does and does not catch

**Catches:**

1. **Fabricated Chinese DOIs**, at high confidence — no wildcard catch-all exists on the ISTIC/CNKI prefixes, so a hallucinated identifier is cleanly refuted.
2. **Chimeric citations** (real DOI, wrong title) within the subset of ISTIC coverage that exposes comparable CSL metadata over an allowlisted HTTPS path — impossible for the existing four resolvers, which 404 on these DOIs entirely.
3. **Fabricated volume/page coordinates** in PubMed-indexed Chinese medical journals, as a high-priority human item.
4. **Systematic visibility of "no source could check this"** — arguably the largest practical gain. Today a Chinese reference silently lands in `unresolvable` and nobody knows it was never actually checked; here every one lands in a checklist row stating which sources were tried and why nothing concluded.

**Does not catch:**

1. Real literature that no open index covers — social-science works, non-core journals, pre-2000 publications, internal reports, theses, conference proceedings, standards. These land in P3 by design, and are expected to remain a large share of any Chinese bibliography.
2. DOI-less non-medical Chinese citations — PubMed covers medicine only, and the ISTIC/CNKI branches require a DOI.
3. Fabricated citations with no identifier at all — technically indistinguishable from real-but-unindexed work. This is the pre-existing OQ-5 recall limit; this resolver makes it visible rather than solving it.
4. Chinese titles for CNKI-registered DOIs — the zero-scraping tradeoff above.
5. Journals outside the seed bridge table (five verified rows at first release, user-extensible via the constructor's `journal_map` argument). The table is built only from publicly redistributable sources (NLM Catalog, ISSN Portal); importing a journal list out of CNKI/Wanfang/VIP is out of bounds.
6. Whether a claim is actually *supported* by the cited source. This resolver answers "does it exist", never "does it support the claim" — the latter is the separate anchor layer, whose gold standard remains a human reading the source.
7. A Chinese work cited with a fully romanized title, no CJK anywhere in the entry, and no `language` field — the Stage 0 gate reads local signals only and skips it. Deciding applicability from the registration agency instead would cost one `doi.org` round-trip for **every English reference in every bibliography**; the applicability gate exists precisely to avoid that, so this narrow case is left to the human rather than billed to English corpora. A caller that has already established the RA can pass it to `is_applicable(entry, ra=...)`.
8. Anything at all when `doi.org` / NCBI are unreachable from the user's network (a live concern inside mainland China), or when a DOI resolver leaves the allowlisted HTTPS boundary. Those paths raise `ChineseLiteratureUnavailable` so the caller must degrade explicitly; they must never be presented as "everything checked out" or as a title verdict.

## Client implementation

`scripts/chinese_literature_client.py`. `ChineseLiteratureClient` exposes `ra_for(doi)`, `doi_lookup_with_title_check(doi, expected_title)`, `handle_exists(doi)`, `journal_bridge(container_title)`, `journal_is_indexed(nlm_ta)`, `pubmed_coordinate_lookup(...)`, `is_applicable(entry)`, and the orchestrating `resolve(entry)`. `doi_lookup_with_title_check` returns a closed `DoiTitleLookupOutcome` with `MATCH`, `MISMATCH`, `NOT_FOUND`, or `UNVERIFIABLE`; transport and malformed-payload failures still raise rather than entering that set. Pass `ncbi_email=` before using either PubMed method; an optional `ncbi_api_key=` is supported. All network methods raise `ChineseLiteratureUnavailable` on degradation per the table above.

Tests: `scripts/test_chinese_literature_client.py`, driven entirely by synthetic checked-in bodies under `scripts/fixtures/transport_bodies/chinese_literature/`. **No CI test performs live network access.**
